<p>Office: Sherman Health Science Research Centre, room 1008</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Research: </strong>Dr. Freud is conducting a research to investigate how the brain represents the shape of objects, tools, scenes and faces. For example, we ask how the brain can distinguish between two hammers based on different features such as color, shape and size. The representations derived by the brain are important to enable everyday perceptual behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>What You Will Be Asked to Do in the Research</strong>:</p>
<p><u>During the online experiment, </u>you will see displays consisting of pictures or dots. You will respond using your keyboard or mouse. You will be compensated for your time and participation in the <u>behavioral studies at the rate of $10</u> per hour, or alternatively for URPP credit (1 credit per 30 minutes). You will not incur costs for participating in this experiment. The study will pay for the research only services.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Discomforts</strong>: The risk to the subjects is minimal. At most, subjects may find the testing too simple or too difficult and become frustrated. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you can stop the experiment at any point.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the Research and Benefits to You</strong>: We do not foresee any direct benefits to you from your participation. There may be benefit for future subjects and society, as these experiments help us elucidate the way the visual system processes information. The benefits from being in the study may include experiencing a sense of satisfaction from contributing to research about how the visual system works.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong>: Your participation in the study is completely voluntary and you may choose to stop participating at any time. Your decision not to volunteer will not influence the nature of the ongoing relationship you may have with the researchers or study staff and the nature of your relationship with York University either now, or in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal from the Study</strong>: You can stop participating in the study at any time, for any reason, if you so decide. If you decide to stop participating, you will still be eligible to receive the promised pay for agreeing to be in the project. Your decision to stop participating, or to refuse to answer particular questions, will not affect your relationship with the researchers, York University, or any other group associated with this project. In the event, you withdraw from the study, all associated data collected will be immediately destroyed wherever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: All information you supply during the research will be held in confidence and unless you specifically indicate your consent, your name will not appear in any report or publication of the research. All data will be stored on a password protected computer, and subjects will be identified only by coded subject number in these records. Only research staff/research team members will have access to this information.<em>).</em> Confidentiality will be provided to the fullest extent possible by law. Note that the data obtained in the experiment might be uploaded to an open external repository to promote collaborative scientific efforts. The data will be ammonized and your identity will not be revealed.</p>
<p>The data collected in this research project may be used &ndash; in an anonymized form - by members of the research team in subsequent research investigations exploring similar lines of inquiry. Such projects will still undergo ethics review by the HPRC, our institutional REB. Any secondary use of anonymized data by the research team will be treated with the same degree of confidentiality and anonymity as in the original research project.</p>
